### 4. Create Database and Role

Open a terminal or command prompt and enter the PostgreSQL shell:

#### macOS/Linux:
```bash
psql postgres
```

#### Windows (cmd):
```cmd
psql -U postgres
```

Then run the following commands **one by one** inside the PostgreSQL shell:

```sql
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS my_database;
DROP ROLE IF EXISTS myproject_user;

CREATE ROLE myproject_user
  WITH LOGIN
  PASSWORD 'mysecretpassword'
  CREATEDB
  CREATEROLE
  INHERIT;

CREATE DATABASE my_database
  OWNER = myproject_user
  ENCODING = 'UTF8'
  LC_COLLATE = 'en_US.UTF-8'
  LC_CTYPE = 'en_US.UTF-8'
  TEMPLATE = template0;
```
If during the commands execution you notice a change (postgres=#   ->  postgres-#) type \r. 
After creating the role, you should see:
```
CREATE ROLE
```

After creating the database, you should see:
```
CREATE DATABASE
```

To quit the shell:
```sql
\q
```

## ğŸ§  Developer Notes

> For testing purposes, we **recommend using an incognito/private tabs on different browser windows**.  
This ensures that localStorage (tokens/keys) is cleared between user sessions.  
If you're creating a new user after logout, make sure to open a new incognito window.
