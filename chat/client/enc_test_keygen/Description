Basic concept is a function that encrypts messages, it is hardcoded for test use.

//try pip install cryptography


basicconcept.py
It is a class that takes and hardcoded message and prints the result.

Encryption Approach
The encryption solution is built using the cryptography library in Python, implementing asymmetric RSA encryption. The key components are:
Key Generation


Uses 4096-bit RSA key pair for strong security
Automatically generates both public and private keys
Keys are generated using rsa.generate_private_key() method
Public exponent set to 65537 (standard secure value)


Encryption Process


1. Converts plain text message to bytes
2. Uses OAEP (Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding) for security
3. Applies SHA256 hashing algorithm for padding
4. Encrypts message using public key
5. Encodes encrypted bytes to base64 for safe transmission


Decryption Process


1. Decodes base64 encrypted message
2. Uses private key to decrypt
3. Applies same OAEP padding with SHA256
4. Converts decrypted bytes back to plain text


Key Security Features


1. No password encryption on private key (for simplicity)
2. Keys can be saved to file system
3. Supports dynamic key generation and management


Error Handling


Comprehensive try-except blocks
Handles encryption and decryption errors
Provides informative error messages


Demonstration Approach
